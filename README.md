# Final Year Project

The final-year project focuses on developing an **Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) System for Early Breast Cancer Detection**. This innovative approach aims to identify breast cancer at its earliest stages, leveraging EITâ€™s non-invasive, radiation-free imaging capabilities to detect anomalies in tissue conductivity associated with malignant growths. This project combines medical imaging technology with advanced signal processing to potentially provide a safer, accessible, and reliable tool for early diagnosis, which is crucial for improving patient outcomes in breast cancer care.
